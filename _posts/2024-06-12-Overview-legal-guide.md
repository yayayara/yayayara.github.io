This blog post series on E-Law is a course offered at the University of Twente in the Master’s program for Computer Science, specializing in cybersecurity. The course, provides an in-depth introduction to the field of E-Law. E-Law addresses the legal challenges arising from the use and misuse of information and communication technologies (ICTs). The aim is to provide an overview of the European Union Law, more specifically to be able to: distinguish legal issues from ethical, political and technical issues. Key topics covered include:

* European legislation on:
  * Protection of Intellectual Property (IP) in an online environment
  * Cybercrime
  * Privacy
  * E-commerce contracts/ consumer protection
* Overview of discussions on:
  * E-governance
  * Telecom law and net neutrality
  * Robot law and AI (regulation of autonomous systems)
  * Techno-regulation

This article introduces E-Law, covering the basics of legal principles, online copyright and the legal protection of software and databases.

## E-Law Introduction

The misuse of ICTs challenges fundamental rights like **legitimacy**, the idea that "code is law," and **legal certainty**. It raises issues about applying traditional copyright law to software and concerns about online privacy. Consumer protection, like responsibility for online banking fraud, and equality, such as accessible online tax filing for older people, are also affected. These challenges relate to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.

### Facilitating or Restricting ICTs: The Legal Dilemma

E-Law has two main goals:

* **Facilitate** the use of ICTs, like Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET).
* **Restrict** the abuse of ICTs, such as through Techno-regulation.

**Lawmakers** are essential in creating these laws. There are two types:

1. **Traditionalists** (lazy lawmakers): Prefer minimal changes and focus on quantity. They keep laws as they are and apply them broadly.
2. **Renewers** (hyperactive lawmakers): Actively create new laws, defining problems, and designing solutions. The EU is an example of an active lawmaker.

### Legal Basics for Non-Lawyers

#### Multi-level Regulation

The world operates under a **multi-level regulation** system, coordinating laws across local, national, and international levels. For example, member states vs. the EU.

#### Treaties/Conventions

* Legal agreements between countries.
* Specify start dates, obligations, and sanctions.
* Aim for global harmonization while maintaining national sovereignty.
* In the EU, treaties establish frameworks for EU Regulations and Directives.

#### EU Regulations and Directives

* **EU Regulations**: Binding and apply directly to all EU member states.
* **EU Directives**: Set goals for member states to achieve through national laws.
* Whether something is a Regulation or Directive is a political decision.

#### Technology Neutral Regulation

Applies regardless of the technology used, ensuring long-term relevance and adaptability.

#### Smart Regulations

Designed with beneficial side effects or considerations beyond their primary goal.

#### Jurisdiction

The authority of a legal body to make decisions and enforce laws within a specific area or over certain types of cases.

#### Case Law

Law established through judicial decisions and interpretations.

## Protection of IP in an Online Environment

### Approach

1. **Property Rights**: Comprehensive right to an object, granting the owner the ability to use, sell, or lease it. Requires everyone's respect.
2. **Intellectual Property (IP)**: Applies universally to patents, trademarks, and copyrights. Enforced without needing others' agreement.
3. **Copyright**: Absolute right, giving creators exclusive use and distribution rights. Licence agreements allow others to use the work under specific terms.
4. **Copyright Online**: Offline protections extended to the online environment.
5. **Copyright on Software**: Original source code is protected. The EU Software Directive ensures software is protected under copyright law in the EU.
6. **Protection of Databases**: The EU Directive protects database structures, not content. Investment protection safeguards the substantial investment in creating databases.

### Intellectual Property as (In)tangible Property

* **Tangible Property**: Includes land, houses, and cars.
* **Intangible Property**: Refers to intellectual property, easily appropriated and reproduced, with negligible marginal costs once created.

### Intellectual Property Backgrounds

* **Industrial Property**: Protects inventions, trademarks, trade secrets.
  * **Patent Law**: Protects novel, non * obvious, and useful inventions.
  * **Trademark Law**: Protects brand names and logos.
  * **Industrial Design Law**: Preserves the visual design of objects.
  * **Trade Secret Law**: Protects confidential business info.
* **Artistic Property**: Protects creative works.
  * **Copyright Law**: Protects original works without registration.
  * **Subsidiary Rights**: Cover performers' and producers' rights.

### Main Objectives of Intellectual Property Rights

* Preserve identity and inspire innovation.
* Provide exclusive exploitation rights, effectively offering a temporary monopoly.
* Ensure freedom-to-operate to avoid infringing on existing rights.
