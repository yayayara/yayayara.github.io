This blog post series on E-Law is a course offered at the University of Twente in the Master’s program for Computer Science, specializing in cybersecurity. The course, taught by Dr. Lesley C.P. Broos, LL.M, provides an in-depth introduction to the field of E-Law. E-Law addresses the legal challenges arising from the use and misuse of information and communication technologies (ICTs). The aim is to provide an overview of the European Union Law, more specifically to be able to: distinguish legal issues from ethical, political and technical issues. Key topics covered include:

* European legislation on:
  * Protection of Intellectual Property (IP) in an online environment
  * Cybercrime
  * Privacy
  * E-commerce contracts/ consumer protection
* Overview of discussions on:
  * E-governance
  * Telecom law and net neutrality
  * Robot law and AI (regulation of autonomous systems)
  * Techno-regulation

This article introduces E-Law, covering the basics of legal principles, online copyright and the legal protection of software and databases.

## E-Law introduction

The (ab)use of ICTs challeges [Fundamental Rights and Principles](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf) such as **legitimacy**, the notion that "code is law" and **legal certainty**. It raises questions about applying traditional copyright law [NL:1912](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001886/2022-10-01) to software and cencerns about privacy protection and whether any privacy exists online. Consumer protection issues, such as responsibility for online banking fraud, and equality, like ensuring accessible online tax filling for older people, are also affected. These challenges are framed within the context of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.

### Facilitating or Restricting ICTs: The Legal Dilemma

E-Law aims to **facilitates** the use of ICTs, such as Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET), and to  **restrict** the abuse of ICTs, like through Techno-regulation (regulation through technology). To create these laws, lawmakers are essential. There are two types of lawmakers: **traditionalists** and **renewers**. Traditionalists, also known as lazy lawmakers, prefer to make minimal changes, mainly focusing on quantity. They like to keep the law as it is and apply it to various areas. On the other hand, renewers, known as hyperactive lawmakers, actively create new laws. They engage in the demanding, non-trivial process of defining problems and designing legal solutions. The European Union is an example of a rather active lawmaker.

### Legal basics for non-lawyers

Navigating the legal landscape can be challenging, especially for non-lawyers. This guide simplifies key concepts to help you understand how different levels of regulation and legal principles interact globally and within the European Union (EU).

#### Multi level regulation

The world operates under a **multi level regulation** system. This involves the coordination of laws across local, national, and international levels. It ensures regulations are aligned and work together efficiently. For examples: member states vs. the EU.

##### Treaties/ conventions

Treaties/ conventions are legal agreements between countries outlining obligations and responsibilities. They specify *start dates and obligations*. *Sanctions* enforce compliance if a country fails to meet its obligations. *Global harmonization* aims to unify rules across countries while maintaining national sovereignty. There is no overarching global *authority* to regulate trieties; compliance relies on mutual agreement. *In the EU, A treaty might establish frameworks for EU Regulations and Directives.*

**EU Regulations and Directives** apply to all European Member states. *EU Regulations* are binding and apply directly to all EU member states without needing national implementation. *EU Directive* sets goals for EU Member States, requiring national laws to achieve these goals. Whether something is a Regulation or a Directive is a *political decision*.

**National laws** incorporate treaties, EU Regulations, and EU Directives, allowing countries to develop their own laws within this framework.

#### Technology Neutral Regulation

Technology neutral regulation applies regardless of the technology used. It ensures long-term relevance and adaptability, providing certainty in legal expectations.

#### Smart Regulations

Smart regulations are designed with beneficial side effects or considerations beyond their primary goal.

#### Jurisdiction

Jurisdiction is the authority of a legal body to make decisions and enforce laws within a specific area or over certain types of cases.

#### Case Law

Case law is law established through judicial decisions and interpretations.

#### Summary of legal basics for non-lawyers

> These concepts illustrates the complex interplay between international treaties, EU Regulations and Directives, national law, and the roles of jurisdiction and case law in shaping the legal landscape.

## Protection of IP in an online environment

The protection of intellectual property (IP) in the digital world applies traditional legal principles to modern technology. This includes the protection of property, IP, and copyright, with a focus on online environments and software.

### Approach

**1. Property rights**
Property rights are the most comprehensive right to an object, granting the owner the ability to use, sell or lease  property. This **fundamental right**; requires everyone's respect. **Relative rights** , like rental contracts, bind only the involved parties.

**2. Intellectual property (IP)**
Intellectual property is a **Comprehensive right**, applying unicersally to patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The law enforces these rights without needing others' agreement.

**3. Copyright**
Copyright is an **absolute right**,giving creators exclusive use and distribute rights. **Licence agreements** allow others to use the work under **licence conditions** that are described in **licence terms**. The terms are set by the owner and are **non-negotiable** and can limit its use and distribution.

**4. Copyright Online**
Offline copyright protections extended to the online environment, applying old rules to new contracts.

**5. Copyright on software**
The original source code written by a programmer is protected. The *EU Software Directive* ensures that software is protected under copyright law in the EU.

**6. Protection of databases**
The [EU Directive](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/%3Furi%3Dcelex%253A31996L0009&ved=2ahUKEwjzyeKB9caGAxWFh_0HHTCBFBgQFnoECA8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw1FYE9nO5idX1-TUOhRRR7N) protects the database structure, not its content. Database contect can be protected by copyright. **Investment protection** safeguards the substantial investment in creating databases, ensuring fair use, because copying is easier than creating one. The directive's **spin-off mechanism** excludes databases created during normal business operations from this protection.

### Intellectual property as (in)tangible property

A simple legal definition of property is the *exclusive long-term right to possess something* Intellectual property is an absolute right, not a personal right. **Tangible property** includes land, houses, and cars. **Intangible property** refers to intellectual property, which represents intangible wealth. It is easily appropriated and reproduced, with negligible marginal costs once created.

### Intellectual property backgrounds

Intellectual property rights protect various forms of creation and innovation. **Industrial property** protects inventions, trademarks, trade secrets. *Patent law* protects novel, non-obvious and useful inventions through registration and examination. *Trademark law* protects brand names and logos requiring registration renewal. *Industrial design law* preserves the visual design of objects. *Trade secret law* (know-how) protects confidential business info, often through *Non Disclosure Agreements (NDA)* . **Artistic property** protects creative works. *Copyright law* protects original works without registration, while *Subsidiary rights* cover performers' and producers'. **Originality** emands independent creation with a degree of creativity, while **Novelty** mandates inventions to be new and undisclosed.

### Main objectives of intellectial property right

Intellectual property rights aim to preserve **identity**, inspire innovation for **encourage people** and confer **pride** or **status** to creators or places. They grand creators  **exclusive exploitation rights** effectibly providing a temporary *monopoly*. By controlling the use and distribution right holders secure their *market position* and prevent unauthorized benefits to competitors. Before market entry, ensuring **freedom-to-operate** is crucial to avoid infringing existing intellectual property rights.

## Directive 2001 29 EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright

[Directive 2001/29/EC](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/%3Furi%3Dcelex%253A32001L0029&ved=2ahUKEwj_0YfL_caGAxW8_rsIHfQnLUsQFnoECBUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1cCsl29XcuUKjmr-LvoD4-), commonly known as the "Copyright Directive," is a European Union directive aimed at harmonizing certain aspects of copyright law across EU member states.

The directive addresses various aspects of copyright law, aiming to adapt it to the challenges posed by the digital age while ensuring a high level of protection for creators. This is the assumption of the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright. the EU between *traditionalists* and *renewers* led to that we should update and add to current copyright laws to match the way the economy is changing, expecially with new ways to use and profit from ideas. Here is a comprehensive summary of its key provisions:

### Right of Reproduction

This gives authors and other right holders the exclusive right to control the reporoduction of their works, whether temporary or permanent, in whole or in part.

### Right of Communication to the Public

Authors also have the sole right to decide how their works are communicated to the public, including making them available through interactive services.

### Right of Distribution

Authors can decide whether to allow the distribution of their original works or copies to the public, by sale or other means.

### Protection of Technological Measures

The directive requires member states to protect against the circumvention of technological measures used by right holders to safeguard their works.

### Exceptions and Limitations

Member states can make exceptions or limitations to copyright for purposes like education or research, as long as they don't unfairly harm the rights of the creators.

### Temporary Acts of Reproduction

Temporary acts of reproduction that are part of a technological process, like caching, aren't covered by copyright protection.

### Remedies and Enforcement

The directive sets up ways to deal with copyright violations, including injunctions, damages, and ways to preserve evidence.

### Collective Management of Rights

It encourages authors and other right holders to manage their rights collectively, through groups like collecting societies, to make it easier to license and use their works.

### Duration of Copyright Protection

The directive sets a standard duration for copyright protection across member states, lasting the life of the author plus 70 years.

In summary, Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright aims to balance copyright protection in the digital age, protecting the rights of authors and other right holders while allowing for reasonable exceptions and limitations to encourage creativity, innovation, and access to knowledge and culture.

## Directive 2009 24 EC on the legal protection of computer programs

Recognizing the need for consistent and robust legal protection across its member states, the European Union introduced Directive 2009/24/EC on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs. This directive aims to harmonize the protection of computer programs across the EU, ensuring that intellectual property rights are upheld and that the internal market functions effectively without discrepancies. By safeguarding the rights of authors and right holders, the directive ensures innovation and fair competition in the software industry.

### Essence of IP Protection

The essence of IP protection lies in the significant resources required to develop computer programs, including human, technical, and financial inputs. In contrast, copying these programs can be done at a fraction of the development cost.

### Harmonization Across the EU

Differences in how computer programs are protected across the EU have direct and adverse effects on the internal market's functioning. These differences need to be eliminated to ensure a cohesive internal market.

### Scope of Protection

A computer program encompasses programs in any form, including those embedded in hardware. It also covers preparatory design work that can lead to the development of a computer program, provided this work could result in a computer program at a later stage.

### Copyright Protection

Only the actual expression of a computer program is protected by copyright. Ideas and principles underlying the program, including interfaces, are not protected. Logic, algorithms, and programming languages are not covered by this directive but are protected by copyright.

### Limited Exception for Computer Programs

Authors' rights to prevent unauthorized reproduction of their work have a limited exception for computer programs. This allows lawful acquirers to reproduce the program technically for use. Loading, running, and correcting errors cannot be prohibited by contract. If no specific contractual terms are specified, any action required for using the program copy may be performed according to its purpose.

### Authorship of Computer Programs

The author is the natural person who created the program. A legal entity can also be designated as the rights holder. If an employee creates a computer program as part of their job duties, the employer holds all economic rights unless a contract states otherwise.

### Restricted Acts

The right holder has the exclusive right to reproduce, modify, and distribute the program.

### Exceptions to the Restricted Acts

Certain acts do not require authorization if no specific terms are specified. Making a backup copy by someone with the right to use the program cannot be prohibited by contract. The person with the right to use the program can observe, study, or test its functionality while performing acts such as loading, displaying, running, transmitting, or storing.

### Decompilation

The right holder's authorization is not needed for code reproduction and translation if essential for achieving interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, provided that:

1. Authorized persons perform the act.
2. Necessary interoperability information is unavailable to those persons.
3. Acts are limited to the parts of the original program required for achieving interoperability.

### Special Measures of Protection

Member states must provide appropriate remedies under their national legislation against individuals committing the following acts:

1. Putting into circulation infringing copies, knowing or having reason to believe they are infringing.
2. Commercial possession of infringing copies.
3. Distribution or possession of means for circumvention.

### Summary of protection of computer programs

> Directive 2009/24/EC ensures that computer programs receive adequate and harmonized protection across the EU, promoting innovation and fair competition in the software industry.

## Directive 96 9 EC on the legal protection of database

Different laws about protecting databases in various countries cause problems for how the market works and how economies grow. Efforts to make these laws more similar aim to fix these problems and make sure competition and new ideas are treated fairly.

### Purpose of the Directive

Current laws in some countries do not provide sufficient protection for databases. Where protection exists, it varies significantly in rules and safeguards. These differences directly harm the functioning of the internal market. Therefore, we need to eliminate these differences to ensure a smooth operation of the market and prevent new discrepancies from appearing. Differences that do not harm the market do not need to be removed. This harmonization aims to protect the internal market, support economic stability, and foster development.

### Rights of Database Owners

Database owners have two primary rights: preventing others from taking and using the content of their databases. This applies to extraction and re-utilization, which are the essence of IP protection. Protecting these rights is crucial for building an information market in the EU, aligning with the EU's goals.

### Importance of Harmonization

The EU believes that without stable and uniform legal protection, investment in modern information systems will not occur. This assumption underscores the need for harmonization. The renewers have expanded the directive to include other materials that are systematically stored, as well as non-electronic databases.

### Rules for Employee-Created Databases

The rules regarding databases created by employees are determined by each member state. This allows for flexibility and local governance while adhering to the overall directive.

### Online Databases and Sui Generis Right

The directive specifies that there is no exhaustion for online databases. Copyright law does not affect databases. The sui generis right empowers the creator of a database to prevent others from unauthorized use. For online databases, this right remains unexhausted.

### Responsibility of Database Creators

The creator of a database is responsible for proving when the database was completed. This includes documenting any changes made to the database over time. This ensures clear ownership and protection of the database creator's rights.

### Summary of the legal protection of databases

> When laws about protecting databases are different, it makes it hard for the market to work well and for economies to grow. Making these laws more similar helps fix these problems and makes sure people who own databases are treated fairly and can come up with new ideas easily.

## Directive 2019 790 on copyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market

The Copyright Directive deals with copyright in the digital world. It sets rules for using protected content online and for sharing content on digital platforms. This directive aims to make sure everyone involved, like creators, users, and online platforms, is treated fairly.

### Subject Matter and Scope

This part of the directive focuses on the digital and cross-border use of protected content. It includes rules on exceptions and limitations to copyright and related rights, as well as regulations aimed at ensuring a well-functioning marketplace for the exploitation of works and other subject matter.

### Text and Data Mining

The directive defines "text and data mining" as an automated analytical technique used to analyze text and data in digital form for various purposes, including generating information such as patterns, trends, and correlations.

### Online Content-Sharing Service Providers

An "online content-sharing service provider" refers to a provider of an information society service whose primary or one of its main purposes is to store and give the public access to a large amount of copyright-protected works or other protected subject matter uploaded by its users. However, certain types of service providers, such as not-for-profit online encyclopedias and educational repositories, are exempt from this definition.

### Exceptions and Limitations of directive in the Digital Single Market

The directive includes exceptions and limitations for various purposes, including text and data mining for scientific research, digital use for teaching purposes, and preservation of cultural heritage. These exceptions ensure that lawful uses of protected content are not unduly restricted.

### Liability of Online Content-Sharing Service Providers

Online content-sharing service providers are required to obtain authorization from right holders for the works or subject matter they share. If no authorization is granted, these providers may be liable for unauthorized acts of communication to the public unless they demonstrate that they have made best efforts to obtain authorization and to prevent the availability of unauthorized content on their platforms.

### Principle of Appropriate and Proportionate Remuneration

Authors and performers are entitled to receive appropriate and proportionate remuneration when they license or transfer their exclusive rights for the exploitation of their works or performances.

### Transparency Obligation

Member States must ensure that authors and performers receive relevant and comprehensive information on the exploitation of their works and performances from the parties to whom they have licensed or transferred their rights.

### Contract Adjustment Mechanism

Authors and performers have the right to claim additional, appropriate, and fair remuneration if the remuneration originally agreed upon turns out to be disproportionately low compared to the subsequent revenues derived from the exploitation of their works or performances.

### Right of Revocation

Authors and performers have the right to revoke, in whole or in part, the license or transfer of their rights if there is a lack of exploitation of their works or other protected subject matter.

### Common Provisions

Contractual provisions that prevent compliance with certain articles of the directive are unenforceable. Additionally, certain articles do not apply to authors of computer programs as defined in Directive 2009/24/EC.

### Summary of the Digital Single Market directive
  
* Copyright exceptions to give wider access
  * Text- and data-mining
  * Digital uses of works for the purpose of illustration for teaching
  * The preservation of cultural heritage
* Protection of press publication for online use
  * Exception for online services providers, not for private/ non-commercial use
* Use of protected content by online content-sharing platforms
* Fair renumeration for authors and performers
* Transparancy and revocation
* Modifying contracts
  * The negotiating rights of authors and performances are strengthened

## Literature/ Prelimitary reading

The literature and preliminary reading aim to understand the evolution of the law. The goal of these readings is to skim through and gain an overview.

In their study, Batchelor & Montani propose ways to update copyright laws for the internet era. They focus on how judges can adjust the laws that suit online activities better. This research sheds a light on the balance between safeguarding rights and ensuring online innovation.

#### Introduction to Batchelor & Montani Study

Batchelor & Montani's study focuses on proposing judicial tools to adapt copyright laws to the challenges of online economy. They aim to address the evolving nature of digital content creation and consumption.

#### Importance of Updating Copyright Laws

The study emphasizes the necessity of updating copyright laws to ensure they remain relevant and effective in the digital age. This includes addressing issues such as online piracy, digital distribution platforms, and user-generated content.

#### Proposed Judicial Tools

Batchelor & Montani suggest several judicial tools to update copyright laws, including:

* Interpretation of Existing Laws: They advocate for a flexible interpretation of existing copyright laws to accommodate new technologies and online practices.
* Case Law Development: The study recommends the development of case law to clarify ambiguous areas of copyright law, especially concerning digital rights management and fair use.
* International Cooperation: Batchelor & Montani propose increased international cooperation to harmonize copyright laws across jurisdictions and address global challenges like cross-border piracy.
* Balancing Rights and Interests:
* The study emphasizes the importance of balancing the rights of content creators with the interests of consumers and online platforms. It suggests that judicial tools should promote innovation and creativity while also protecting intellectual property rights.

#### Conclusion

Batchelor & Montani's study provides valuable insights into the role of judicial tools in updating copyright laws for online economy. By advocating for a flexible and adaptive approach, they seek to ensure that copyright remains an effective mechanism for protecting creativity and innovation in the digital era.

### Hellstadius - Software Patents

Software patents have been a subject of debate in recent years, raising questions about their effectiveness, implications, and ethical considerations. Understanding the landscape of software patents involves exploring various aspects such as their legal framework, practical applications, and impact on innovation.

#### Legal Framework

Software patents operate within the framework of intellectual property law, particularly patent law. They grant inventors exclusive rights to their software inventions, allowing them to prevent others from using, selling, or distributing their patented technologies without permission. However, the criteria for patentability and the scope of protection vary across jurisdictions, leading to inconsistencies and challenges in enforcing software patents globally.

#### Practical Applications

In practice, software patents cover a wide range of technologies and innovations, including algorithms, computer programs, and digital processes. They are often used by technology companies to protect their investments in research and development and gain a competitive advantage in the market. However, the reproduction of software patents has also led to concerns about patent thickets, where overlapping patents create barriers to entry for new innovators.

#### Impact on Innovation

The impact of software patents on innovation is a contentious issue. Proponents argue that patents encourage investment in technology and promote innovation by rewarding inventors for their creations. However, critics contend that software patents suppress competition, and hinder progress. Particularly in industries with low entry barriers. Moreover, the fast pace of technological advancement makes it challenging for patent offices to keep up with the evolving nature of software inventions.

#### Conclusion of Software Patents

In the EU, the requirement for technical character is still very elusive. The protection of software patents still is a matter for national law. Some issues are licensing, open source, the application of the inventive step requirement to such patent applications.

## Case law on protection of copyright online, computer programs and databases

Case law is the body of law created by court decisions. It sets legal precedents for future cases. Courts use case law to interpret laws and resolve disputes. It helps clarify the meaning of laws and regulations. Case law reflects societal norms and values.

### Protection of Copyright Online - Directive 2001/29/EC

#### C-5/08 Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening

Storing and printing out an extract of a protected work comprising 11 words establish reproduction in part under Directive 2001/29/EC. Printing out an 11-word extract during a data capture process is long-term and requires consent from relevant rightholders under Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/29.

#### C-462/09 Stichting de Thuiskopie v Opus Supplies Deutschland GmbH and Others

Final users reproducing protected works privately are responsible for fair compensation under Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29. Member States ensure authors to receive fair compensation for private copying harm, even if the seller is located elsewhere.

#### C-467/08 Padawan v SGAE

1. 'Fair compensation' under Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 is calculated based on harm caused to authors by private copying.

2. Digital reproduction equipment providers are liable for fair compensation financing, linked to private copying use.

#### C-145/10 Eva-Maria Painer v Standard VerlagsGmbH, Axel Springer AG, Süddeutsche Zeitung GmbH, Spiegel-Verlag Rudolf Augstein GmbH & Co KG, Verlag M. DuMont Schauberg Expedition der Kölnischen Zeitung GmbH & Co KG

1. A portrait photograph can be copyright-protected if it's an intellectual creation reflecting the author's personality.

2. Media cannot use copyright-protected works for public security without specific, coordinated actions with competent authorities.

3. Press reports quoting works not protected by copyright can apply Article 5(3)(d) of Directive 2001/29.

4. Article 5(3)(d) requires indicating the source of quoted works, but it's fulfilled by indicating the source alone if the author's name isn't available.

#### C-360/10 Belgische Vereniging van Auteurs, Componisten en Uitgevers CVBA (Sabam) v Netlog NV

Directives 2000/31/EC, 2001/29/EC, and 2004/48/EC prohibit national courts from issuing injunctions requiring hosting service providers to install filtering systems at their expense indefinitely to prevent copyright breaches.

#### C-277/10 Martin Luksan v Petrus van der Let

**1. Exploitation Rights and Allocation:**
Directives 93/83/EEC, 2001/29/EC, 2006/115/EC, and 2006/116/EC establish that the rights to exploit a cinematographic work, like reproduction and broadcasting, belong to the principal director. Any law giving these rights exclusively to the producer goes against EU rules.

**2. Presumption of Transfer:**
Countries can assume that exploitation rights go to the producer, but not in a way that can't be changed. This lets the principal director negotiate differently.

**3. Fair Compensation:**
The principal director, as the creator of a film, has a right to fair payment under Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29.

**4. Restrictions on Presumption of Transfer:**
National laws can't assume the producer gets fair compensation rights, whether without question or with exceptions. This goes against EU law.

#### C-351/12 OSA – Ochranný svaz autorský pro práva k dílům hudebním o.s. v Léčebné lázně Mariánské Lázně a.s.

**Communication Rights:**
Directive 2001/29 stops countries from blocking authors' control over how their works are shared. This includes spas piping TV or radio to patients' rooms.

**Interpretation by Collecting Societies:**
Copyright groups can't use Directive 2001/29 against national laws. But courts should follow the directive's goals when interpreting laws.

**Collective Management and Competition:**
Countries can let one group manage copyrights, but overcharging or unfair prices might break competition rules.

#### C-435/12 ACI Adam BV and Others v Stichting de Thuiskopie, Stichting Onderhandelingen Thuiskopie vergoeding

**Law on Private Copying:**
Directive 2001/29 says national laws must differentiate between legal and illegal sources for private copying.

**Exclusion from Directive 2004/48/EC:**
The enforcement directive doesn't cover cases where those who pay remuneration dispute with the collection body.

#### C-360/13 Public Relations Consultants Association Ltd v Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd and Others

2. Media levies for private copying are allowed but must be justified by the media's role and importance;
3. Producers and importers may owe compensation for mobile phone memory cards likely used for private copying;
4. Countries can exempt some cases from compensation if the harm to rightholders is minimal and fair;
5. Rightholders' permissions for file use don't affect fair compensation under private copying exceptions;
6. Tech measures for protected works don't cancel compensation but might change its amount;
7. Compensation laws don't apply to copies made from illegal sources.

#### C-466/12 Nils Svensson and Others v Retriever Sverige AB

1. Linking to freely available works on other sites isn't public communication.
2. Countries can't expand the concept of public communication beyond Directive 2001/29.

#### C-201/13 Johan Deckmyn, Vrijheidsfonds VZW v Helena Vandersteen and others

1. Parody in Article 5(3)(k) is an independent concept in EU law.
2. Parody must evoke an existing work with clear differences, showing humor or mockery. Extra originality isn't needed.

#### C-419/13 Art & Allposters International BV v Stichting Pictoright

Article 4(2)'s exhaustion rule doesn't apply if a reproduced work, after legal sale, is altered and resold.

#### C-160/15 GS Media

Linking to protected works without profit and knowledge of illegality isn't public communication under Directive 2001/29.

#### C-527/15 Filmspeler

1. Selling multimedia players with pre-installed links to protected works is public communication.
2. Temporary copies from streaming without consent don't meet Directive 2001/29's conditions.

#### C-610/15 The Pirate Bay

Platforms facilitating the sharing of copyrighted works are public communication under Directive 2001/29.

### Protection of computer programs under EU Directives

**GUI protection:** GUIs are not protected as computer programs, but can be protected as works if they are original.
**Broadcasting GUI** is not "communication to the public".
**Functionality and expression:** The functionality, programming languages, and data file formats of software are not protected by copyright.
**Observation, Study, Testing:** Licensees can study and test software to understand its underlying ideas and principles withou infringement copyright.
**User manual reproduction:** Copying elements from a user manual can infringe copyright if it reflects the authors' intellectual creation.
**Exhausting of distribution right:** The distribution right is exhausted once a copy of the software is downloaded with authorization and for an unlimited period in exchange for a fee.
**Resale of user license:** Resolve of software licenses and copies is allowed under the exhaution principle, making subsequent acquires lawful users with reproduction rights.
**Resale of software:** The initial acquirer can resell the software and the associated licence.
**Back-up copies** cannot be transferred to new acquires if the original copy is lost or destroyed without the copyright holder's permission.

### Protection of databases under EU Directive

#### Investment in database contents

**Investment in obtaining** refers to resources used to seek out and collect existing materials, not to the creating of new materials. **Investment in verification** involves ensuring the reliability of collected materials, but not the resources used during the creation stage of these materials.

#### Extraction and re-utilisation

Unauthorized acts of appropriation and distribution of database contents. **Right to prevent** database creators can prevent extraction and re-utilisation regardless of whether the content are publicly accessible. 

#### Substantial part

**Quantitative and qualitative evaluation** can be based on volume (quantitative) or the investment scale (qualitative). **Cumulative extraction** is the repeated extraction of insubstantial parts can cumulatively consitute a substantial extraction.

#### Definition of databases

**Database** is any collection of separatable works, data or materials with a retrieval system. **Investment in contents** excludes the resources used to create the materials.

#### Extraction definition

**On-screen consultation** is transferring material from one database to another following on-screen consultation can be extraction. **Evaluation** whether it constitues extraction depend on whether a substantial part, quantitatively or qualitative has been transferred.

#### Permanent vs. temporary transfer

Based on how long materials are stored outside the orignal database. **Independent of purpose** is that the purpose, modification, or database management software do not affect the definition of extraction. **Comparison of materials** evaluates the volume of extracted materials relative to the total contents of the database or its modules.

#### Investment in database contents of obtaining materials

**Obtaining** refers to collecting existing materials, not creating new materials.

#### Database copyright protection

This depend on the **originality** in the selection or arrangement of data. **Irrelevance of skill and labour** in creating a database do not justify copyright if there is no originality.

#### Meta search engine

A meta search engine **re-utilises** a database if it mimics the databases functionality, translates user queries in real-time, and present results similary.
