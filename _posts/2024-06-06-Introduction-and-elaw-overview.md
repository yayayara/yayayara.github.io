# Online Copyright and Software & Database Protection: A Beginner's Legal Guide

This blog post series on E-Law is a course offered at the University of Twente in the Masterâ€™s program for Computer Science, specializing in cybersecurity. The course, taught by Dr. Lesley C.P. Broos, LL.M, provides an in-depth introduction to the field of E-Law. E-Law addresses the legal challenges arising from the use and misuse of information and communication technologies (ICTs). The aim is to provide an overview of the European Union Law, more specifically to be able to: distinguish legal issues from ethical, political and technical issues. Key topics covered include:

* European legislation on:
  * Protection of Intellectual Property (IP) in an online environment
  * Cybercrime
  * Privacy
  * E-commerce contracts/ consumer protection
* Overview of discussions on:
  * E-governance
  * Telecom law and net neutrality
  * Robot law and AI (regulation of autonomous systems)
  * Techno-regulation

This article introduces E-Law, covering the basics of legal principles, online copyright and the legal protection of software and databases.

## E-Law introduction

The (ab)use of ICTs challeges [Fundamental Rights and Principles](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf) such as **legitimacy**, the notion that "code is law" and **legal certainty**. It raises questions about applying traditional copyright law [NL:1912](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001886/2022-10-01) to software and cencerns about privacy protection and whether any privacy exists online. Consumer protection issues, such as responsibility for online banking fraud, and equality, like ensuring accessible online tax filling for older people, are also affected. These challenges are framed within the context of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.

### Facilitating or Restricting ICTs: The Legal Dilemma

E-Law aims to **facilitates** the use of ICTs, such as Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET), and to  **restrict** the abuse of ICTs, like through Techno-regulation (regulation through technology). To create these laws, lawmakers are essential. There are two types of lawmakers: **traditionalists** and **renewers**. Traditionalists, also known as lazy lawmakers, prefer to make minimal changes, mainly focusing on quantity. They like to keep the law as it is and apply it to various areas. On the other hand, renewers, known as hyperactive lawmakers, actively create new laws. They engage in the demanding, non-trivial process of defining problems and designing legal solutions. The European Union is an example of a rather active lawmaker.

### Legal basics for non-lawyers

#### Multi level regulation

The world operates under a **multi level regulation** system. This involves the coordination of laws across local, national, and international levels. It ensures regulations are aligned and work together efficiently. For examples: member states vs. the EU.

##### Treaties/ conventions

Treaties/ conventions are legal agreements between countries outlining obligations and responsibilities. They specify *start dates and obligations*. *Sanctions* enforce compliance if a country fails to meet its obligations. *Global harmonization* aims to unify rules across countries while maintaining national sovereignty. There is no overarching global *authority* to regulate trieties; compliance relies on mutual agreement. *In the EU, A treaty might establish frameworks for EU Regulations and Directives.*

**EU Regulations and Directives** apply to all European Member states. *EU Regulations* are binding and apply directly to all EU member states without needing national implementation. *EU Directive* sets goals for EU Member States, requiring national laws to achieve these goals. Whether something is a Regulation or a Directive is a *political decision*.

**National laws** incorporate treaties, EU Regulations, and EU Directives, allowing countries to develop their own laws within this framework.

#### Technology Neutral Regulation

Technology neutral regulation applies regardless of the technology used. It ensures long-term relevance and adaptability, providing certainty in legal expectations.

#### Smart Regulations

Smart regulations are designed with beneficial side effects or considerations beyond their primary goal.

#### Jurisdiction

Jurisdiction is the authority of a legal body to make decisions and enforce laws within a specific area or over certain types of cases.

#### Case Law

Case law is law established through judicial decisions and interpretations.

> These concepts illustrates the complex interplay between international treaties, EU Regulations and Directives, national law, and the roles of jurisdiction and case law in shaping the legal landscape.

## Protection of IP in an online environment

The protection of intellectual property (IP) in the digital world applies traditional legal principles to modern technology. This includes the protection of property, IP, and copyright, with a focus on online environments and software.

### Approach

**1. Property rights**
Property rights are the most comprehensive right to an object, granting the owner the ability to use, sell or lease  property. This **fundamental right**; requires everyone's respect. **Relative rights** , like rental contracts, bind only the involved parties.
**2. Intellectual property (IP)**
Intellectual property is a **Comprehensive right**, applying unicersally to patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The law enforces these rights without needing others' agreement.
**3. Copyright**
Copyright is an **absolute right**,giving creators exclusive use and distribute rights. **Licence agreements** allow others to use the work under **licence conditions** that are described in **licence terms**. The terms are set by the owner and are **non-negotiable** and can limit its use and distribution.
**4. Copyright Online**
Offline copyright protections extended to the online environment, applying old rules to new contracts.
**5. Copyright on software**
The original source code written by a programmer is protected. The *EU Software Directive* ensures that software is protected under copyright law in the EU.
**6. Protection of databases**
The [EU Directive](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/%3Furi%3Dcelex%253A31996L0009&ved=2ahUKEwjzyeKB9caGAxWFh_0HHTCBFBgQFnoECA8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw1FYE9nO5idX1-TUOhRRR7N) protects the database structure, not its content. Database contect can be protected by copyright. **Investment protection** safeguards the substantial investment in creating databases, ensuring fair use, because copying is easier than creating one. The directive's **spin-off mechanism** excludes databases created during normal business operations from this protection.

### Intellectual property as (in)tangible property

A simple legal definition of property is the *exclusive long-term right to possess something* Intellectual property is an absolute right, not a personal right. **Tangible property** includes land, houses, and cars. **Intangible property** refers to intellectual property, which represents intangible wealth. It is easily appropriated and reproduced, with negligible marginal costs once created.

### Intellectual property backgrounds

Intellectual property rights protect various forms of creation and innovation. **Industrial property** protects inventions, trademarks, trade secrets. *Patent law* protects novel, non-obvious and useful inventions through registration and examination. *Trademark law* protects brand names and logos requiring registration renewal. *Industrial design law* preserves the visual design of objects. *Trade secret law* (know-how) protects confidential business info, often through *Non Disclosure Agreements (NDA)* . **Artistic property** protects creative works. *Copyright law* protects original works without registration, while *Subsidiary rights* cover performers' and producers'. **Originality** emands independent creation with a degree of creativity, while **Novelty** mandates inventions to be new and undisclosed.

### Main objectives of intellectial property right

Intellectual property rights aim to preserve **identity**, inspire innovation for **encourage people** and confer **pride** or **status** to creators or places. They grand creators  **exclusive exploitation rights** effectibly providing a temporary *monopoly*. By controlling the use and distribution right holders secure their *market position* and prevent unauthorized benefits to competitors. Before market entry, ensuring **freedom-to-operate** is crucial to avoid infringing existing intellectual property rights.
