Before you read this article, please try solving the lab on your own, and only refer back here if you get stuck.

A bit of background on MemLabs: these  practice labs are created by stuxnet999(P. Abhiram Kumar), the former captain of teambi0s, a top Indian CTF team. There are 6 labs available in the [Memlabs repository](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs/tree/master). Although these labs are 3 to 5 years old, they are still highly relevant for testing my memory forensics skills. In this challenge, I primarily use Volatility 3, but occasionally Volatility 2 is used, which will be clearly indicated in the code.

**Challenge category**
Memory Forensics, Windows

**Challenge difficulty**
Easy

**Date**
July 2020

**About Memlabs**
MemLabs is an educational, introductory set of CTF-styled challenges which is aimed to encourage students, security researchers and also CTF players to get started with the field of Memory Forensics. “I’d suggest everyone use The Volatility Framework for analysing the memory images”, the main tool being used is going to be Volatility.

Now lets start with the lab. The scenario given to us is:
> My sister's computer crashed. We were very fortunate to recover this memory dump. Your job is get all her important files from the system. From what we remember, we suddenly saw a black window pop up with some thing being executed. When the crash happened, she was trying to draw something. Thats all we remember from the time of crash.

## How to approach memory forensics

To conduct memory forensics, there is a general approach. In each step, the following artifacts are examined:

1. Identify suspicious processes
   1. Name, location, parentprocess, commandline, start time and security IDs;
2. Analyze the DLLs and handles of processes
   1. DLLs, handles and commandline;
3. Investigate network artifacts
   1. Ports, connections and processes;
4. Search for evidence of code injection and rootkits
   1. Unlinked processes, unlinked DLLs, executable memory sections;
5. Dump suspicious processes and/or other data
   1. System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT), Interrupt Descript Table (IDT), Import Address Table (IAT) and I/O Request Packets (IRP);

## Start

The first thing that stands out in the scenario is a black window pop-up indicating that something was executed, and that she was drawing something during the crash.

So after spinning up the virtal machine made for this memory forensics series and downloading the memory dump, lets fire up our volatility and get to work.

## Flag 1

The first thing we want to know is which processes were running when the computer crashed, in this case when the memory dump was taken. From the information given on the MemLabs website, we know that this memory dump is from a Windows machine. To check that, we run the following command:
> $ python3 vol.py -f ../Documents/MemLabs/01/Memorydump_Lab1.raw windows.pslist

Now, we need to carefully look through the memory dump and check for any unusual/ suspicious processes. After some investigation, we find these processes suspicious: **mspaint.exe**, **WinRAR.exe** and **cmd.exe**. We want to look at 'mspaint.exe', because this program is probably used when she was trying to draw something. The processed **WinRAR.exe** and **cmd.exe** were executed by the Explorer.exe process, which may not be normal behavior. The process **dumpit.exe** is probably used to collect the memory dump.

_All the red processes seem out of place

Now lets look at the commandline which commands are executed. This is done by executing the command:
> $ python3 vol.py -f ../Documents/MemLabs/01/Memorydump_Lab1.raw windows.cmdline

As we can see from the output, we see the execution of mspaint, which was stated in the description that this program was being used during the time a black window popped up. We also see that WinRAR is used to run the WinRAR application and open the specified archive file. 
**"C:/Program Files\WinRAR\WinRAR.exe"**: This part of the command specifies the path to the WinRAR executable.
**"C:\Users\Alissa Simpson\Documents\Important.rar"**: This part of the command specifies the path to the RAR archive that you want to open.

We can use consoles plugin from Volatility 2 to see the output: 
> $ vol.py -f ../Documents/MemLabs/01/MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 consoles

As soon as we run the command, we see something written on the console. It appears to be a base64 string from the user SmartNet executing *ST4G3$1*. Output: **ZmxhZ3t0aDFzXzFzX3RoM18xc3Rfc3Q0ZzMhIX0=**

![Flag 1](1/flag1.png)
_Flag 1

To convert the base64 string to plain text, we use the command
> $ echo ZmxhZ3t0aDFzXzFzX3RoM18xc3Rfc3Q0ZzMhIX0= | base64 -d

After executing this command, we get the flag: **flag{th1s_1s_th3_1st_st4g3!!}**

## Flag 2

This is not the only flag in this challenge, but 1 of the three, so we have to keep looking for the other two. Lets also check the other unusual/ suspicious processes if they have something in them. So as we know we have the WinRAR process running, so it has files of .rar type. We also have seen that with the cmdline, that the file important.rar exist.

Therefore, we’re using the command
> $ python3 vol.py -f ../Documents/MemLabs/01/Memorydump_Lab1.raw windows.filescan

With this, the command complete an entire file scan, but this results in a huge output. Therefore, we’re grepping on “rar”.
> $ python3 vol.py -f ../Documents/MemLabs/01/Memorydump_Lab1.raw windows.filescan | grep rar

![important.rar](1/important.png)
_Output of the .rar filescan

Now we have found the location where this file is present. We will now dump its contents using the dumpfiles plugin. We should also give the memory location of the file using the -Q flag:
> $ python3 vol.py -f ../Documents/MemLabs/01/Memorydump_Lab1.raw -o ../Documents/MemLabs/01/ windows.dumpfiles —physaddr 0x3fa3ebc0

When we try to extract the Important.rar file with executing the following command we are getting asked for a password.
> $ unrar e ../Documents/MemLabs/01/file.0x3fa3ebc0.0xfa8001034450.DataSectionObject.Important.rar.dat

![Getting asked for the password](1/asked.png)
_Password protected

In the notes of this message, they say that Password is NTLM hash of Alissa’s account passwd. So we can check the hash dump.
> $ python3 vol.py -f ../Documents/MemLabs/01/Memorydump_Lab1.raw  windows.hashdump.Hashdump

![Finding the password](1/password.png)
_We got the hash for Alissa

Now finally we can get the flag, we only need to fill in the nthash, but in uppercase. To do this, we are converting the string to uppercase
> $ echo f4ff64c8baac57d22f22edc681055ba6 | tr [:lower:] [:upper:]

Now we execute again the command to open up the important.rar
> $ unrar e ../Documents/MemLabs/01/file.0x3fa3ebc0.0xfa8001034450.DataSectionObject.Important.rar.dat

And fill in the password:  **F4FF64C8BAAC57D22F22EDC681055BA6**

The password was right and we’ve extracted flag3.png. Now, we take a look at flag3.

![Flag 3](1/flag3.png)
_Flag 3

We will get the following image with the flag 3: **flag{w3ll_3rd_stage_was_easy}**

## Flag 3

Now that we have flags 1 and 3, we only need to find flag 2. In the list of processes, a third process was running: mspaint, and Alissa was painting something when the computer suddenly crashed. We will attempt to see what she was painting at that time. We can use the *memdump plugin* in Volatility to extract memory information from that process:

> $ vol.py -f ../Documents/MemLabs/01/MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 memdump -p 2424 -D ../Documents/MemLabs/01/

And them rename 2424.dmp to 2424.data for open it in GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). After a while, playing with the width and offset we find the flag.
